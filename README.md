# 📝 To-Do List 📝

👻 A To-Do is an entity that, in our case, needs to have a title, description, and status.

✅ And, since we care about knowing which one we already completed, we need a way to change its status.

What about a To-Do List?

A To-Do List is a list of To-Dos! DUH! 🤦‍♂️

And it needs a couple of things to function:

First, To-Dos!

👀 And we should be able to see them to keep track of them.

But what do you do with them apart from seeing them?

➕ You can add a new one.

➖ And you can remove them.

Quite easy, right?

Since we will be coding in JavaScript, we will use classes. 🧱

Why classes?

🍪 Because they are like cookie-cutters we can reuse.

We can have a To-Do List for work 🏢 and another for personal stuff. 🏠

Do we need to create it from scratch every time we want a new list?

Or does it make more sense to reuse the code we already made?

Well, that's why we will use classes.

But...

Should every To-Do be created from scratch?

Let's have a look:

🟡 Task 1:

<pre>
{ 
   title: "Chop onions", 
   description: "Careful with the knife", 
   isCompleted: false 
}
</pre>

🔵 Task 2:

<pre>
{ 
   title: "Call mom", 
   description: "She needs help with the wifi",
   isCompleted: false 
}
</pre>

🔴 Task 3:

<pre>
{
   title: "Work out", 
   description: "If not my back hurts", 
   isCompleted: false
}
</pre>

Shall we continue?

I don't have time for this! So, let me use a class:

<pre>
class ToDo {
  constructor(title, description) {
    this.title = title;
    this.description = description;
    this.isComplete = false;
  }

  markAsComplete() {
    this.isComplete = true;
  }

  markAsIncomplete() {
    this.isComplete = false;
  }
}
</pre>

See! My cookie-cutter.

🍪 Now, let me create my cookies:

`const todo1 = new ToDo {"Chop onions", "Careful with the knife", isCompleted: false};`

`const todo2 = new ToDo {"Call mom", "She needs help with hte wifi", isCompleted: false};`

`const todo3 = new ToDo {"Work out", "If not my back hurts", isCompleted: false};`

🚀 Way faster than creating one by one!

🐛 Now that you understand the project and why we are using classes, help me debug my code!
